Feel free to browse a few of my coding projects. You might notice that all of the projects listed are in Python, that is because I like Python the most, I have some experience in 
Java as well because that is the language my Computer Science class (at school) is taught in. Overall, I'm not the most experienced coder in the world, but I am always willing to 
expand my skills and conceptual understanding!
